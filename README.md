Magical Flower Finder is an application that find best plants for flower garden. It uses keywords in finding a flower based on given parameters. 
Moreover, it uses location codes and suggest only plants tough enough to survive at local growing zone. It also take advantage of flower´s local blooming time and suggest mathing flowering companion. 


## Background
Have you ever experienced the magic of flowering garden? Elegant garden spread joy and happiness in every season. Would it be a pleasure to have your own charming oasis. Gardening can become a loved passion but inexperienced gardeners may not know where to start. This AI supported Magical Flower finder helps to construct a flower garden.

Flowers have a specific blooming times. Flowers blooms earlier in southern gardens and later elsewhear. A perfect combo match in hights, colours, conditions and peak bloom times. 

There are immense amount of gardening information available in internet, but it is challenging to adjust the given information to northern grown zone. Experience gardeners keep garden blooming from early summer on through to first frost. Beginners would need accurate information over the species, especially how selected flowers succeed in cold climates and AI´s support would be most welcome.



## How is it used?

This project will collect information from varios sources. Magical Gardener recognizes flowers across various types and features   
* color
* hight
* plant spacing
* growing zone 
* environmental factors such as need of sun light and type of soil
* blooming peak
* annual/ perennial 

Magical Flower finder utilizes user location and combine it towards hardiness zone map (https://www.plantmaps.com/index.php) to narrow search results. 


## Data sources and AI methods

Data source for the Magical Flower finder should be the most poppular websites of botanical and horticular interest and hardiness zone map.

Magical Flower finder uses Natural Language Processing to recognize how the given features are in connection to location of data source. 


## Challenges

Grow zone dependent parameters at least in Scandinavia are available in locally spoken languages, 
while essential floral information is provided mainly in English. Could AI combine and analyse data from various languages? 

## What next?

Magical Flower finder would not know how accurate its recommendations were, if it users do not give it feedback. In order to learn and develop, Magical Flower finder would benefit for a interactive experiences such us a hub where users share Magical Gardener´s recommendations.
